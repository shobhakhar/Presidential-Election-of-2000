# The Dramatic U.S. Presidential Election of 2000.
The U.S. presidential election of November 7, 2000, was one of the closest in history. 
As returns were counted on election night it became clear that the outcome in the state of Florida would determine the next president. 
At one point in the evening, television networks projected that the state was carried by the Democratic nominee, Al Gore, but a retraction of the projection followed a few hours later. 
Then, early in the morning of November 8, the networks projected that the Republican nominee, George W. Bush, had carried
Florida and won the presidency. Gore called Bush to concede. 
While en route to his concession speech, though, the Florida count changed rapidly in his favor. 
The networks once again reversed their projection, and Gore called Bush to retract his concession. 
When the roughly 6 million Florida votes had been counted, Bush was shown to be leading by only 1,738, and the narrow margin triggered an automatic recount. 
The recount, completed in the evening of November 9, showed Bush’s lead to be less than 400.
Meanwhile, angry Democratic voters in Palm Beach County complained that a confusing
“butterfly” lay-out ballot caused them to accidentally vote for the Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan instead of Gore. 

The ballot listed presidential candidates on both a left-hand and a right-hand page. 
Voters were to register their vote by punching the circlecorresponding to their choice, from the column of circles between the pages. 
It was suspected that since Bush’s name was listed first on the left-hand page, Bush voters likely selected the first circle.
Since Gore’s name was listed second on the left-hand side, many voters—who already knew who
they wished to vote for—did not bother examining the right-hand side and consequently selected the
second circle in the column; the one actually corresponding to Buchanan. 
Two pieces of evidence supported this claim: Buchanan had an unusually high percentage of the vote in that county, and an
unusually large number of ballots (19,000) were discarded because voters had marked two circles
(possibly by inadvertently voting for Buchanan and then trying to correct the mistake by then voting for Gore)

## Task 1 : What evidence is there in the scatterplot of that Buchanan received more votes than expected in Palm Beach County? 
## Task 2: Analyze the data without Palm Beach County results to obtain an equation for predicting Buchanan votes from Bush votes.
## Obtain a 95% prediction interval for the number of Buchanan votes in Palm Beach from this result—assuming the relationship is the same in this county as in the others. 
## If it is assumed that Buchanan’s actual count contains a number of votes intended for Gore, what can be said about the likely size of this number from the prediction interval? (Consider transformation.)
